# OI.EYE.1
Over-imitation – copying perceivably causally irrelevant actions – is consistently observed in human children and adults. Depending on the type of irrelevant action, it is often debatable, however, whether irrelevant actions are identified as such in over-imitation tasks, especially by children. Using a paired preference eye-tracking paradigm, this study investigated whether irrelevant actions with no contact to a target object (noncontact actions) are easier to identify as being irrelevant than actions involving physical contact with the target object (pseudo-instrumental actions) by four-year-olds (N=24) and adults (N=22). Looking time preferences revealed that children and adults distinguish both types of irrelevant actions from relevant actions, but more easily identify noncontact action as being irrelevant than pseudo-instrumental actions.
